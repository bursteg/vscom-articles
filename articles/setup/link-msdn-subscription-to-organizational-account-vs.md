# Add a work account to your MSDN subscription


When activating an MSDN subscription, you must use a Microsoft account. You can also 
add a work account to your subscription so that you can use this account with Visual 
Studio Online and Microsoft Azure, if your subscription includes these benefits.


1. [Sign in to your MSDN My Account page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/) 
with your Microsoft account. You see your subscription benefits here.

[sign up for a new Visual Studio Online account](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=307137).

## Q&amp;A

#### Q:  Why can't I add a work account to my MSDN subscription?


A:  You can add a work account only to MSDN subscriptions that include Visual Studio 
Online or Microsoft Azure.


#### Q:  Can I add more than one work account to my MSDN subscription?


A:  No, you can add only one work account.


#### Q:  Why can't I sign in with my work account after adding it to my subscription or getting invited to Visual Studio Online?


A:  This can happen when the sign-in address for your work account differs from your 
Microsoft account. Check with the Visual Studio Online account owner. They might not 
have [set up work access](https://www.visualstudio.com/get-started/setup/manage-organization-access-for-your-account-vs)
for the Visual Studio Online account.


#### Q:  Why doesn't Visual Studio Online recognize me as an MSDN subscriber?


A:  You must have an [eligible MSDN subscription](https://www.visualstudio.com/get-started/setup/assign-licenses-to-users-vs#EligibleMSDNSubscriptions)
that includes Visual Studio Online, and your license in Visual Studio Online must be
[set to "Eligible MSDN Subscriber"](https://www.visualstudio.com/get-started/setup/assign-licenses-to-users-vs). Try these other

if Visual Studio Online still doesn't recognize your subscription.
