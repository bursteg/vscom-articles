# Application Insights for Android, iOS, Windows Phone and other platforms


*Application Insights is in Preview.*



Visual Studio Application Insights lets you monitor your mobile application for usage, events, and crashes.


## What does it do?

- Performance trends aggregated from all devices that use your app
- Crash reporting and analysis
- Usage data out of the box - user, session and page view counts, device, OS, and location
- Track usage patterns to assess each feature of your app
- Correlate telemetry from devices and server

## How does it work?

- Telemetry data is buffered in the devices, sent to the Application Insights portal at low-impact times, and aggregated in the portal.
- You can search the raw data in [Diagnostic Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-diagnostic-search/), and see aggregated statistics in [Metric Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-metrics-explorer/).
