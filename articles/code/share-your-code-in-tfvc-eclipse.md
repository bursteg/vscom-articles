# Share your code in TFVC using Eclipse


Share your code with your team with Visual Studio Online and Eclipse.



Before you start:


1. If you don't have a Visual Studio Online account, [create it first](../../setup/sign-up-for-visual-studio-online.md).
2. If you have not yet connected to a team project in your Visual Studio Online account, [do that now](../../setup/connect-to-visual-studio-online.md).


If your team project uses TFVC in your Visual Studio Online account, read on. However, if your team project uses Git in your Visual Studio Online account,then read [Share your code in Git using Eclipse](../share-your-code-in-git-eclipse.md)
