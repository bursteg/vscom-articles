# Set up Visual Studio





Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that works with Visual Studio Online (VSO), 
a set of complementary cloud services that teams can use to share code, track work, and ship software. 
When you store your code, tests, and test results using VSO, you can access your code from anywhere 
with Visual Studio or other development tools, build your app, run tests, and deploy. No setup needed.







To get started, download and install Visual Studio, then create your Visual Studio Online account.





1. If you don't have Visual Studio installed, 
[download your version now](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309297&amp;clcid=0x409&amp;slcid=0x409), 
then install.







If you have an MSDN subscription or a Visual Studio Online license, 
get the version that's available for your subscription or license.

2. When you start Visual Studio, sign in to create your Visual Studio profile. [Why create a profile?](set-up-vs.md#why-sign-in)

3. Enter your Microsoft account (for example, @outlook.com or @hotmail.com), 
or your work or school account (for example, @fabrikam.com).







If you have an MSDN subscription or a Visual Studio Online license, 
use the sign-in address for that subscription or license.

4. Create your Visual Studio profile. You only have to do this once.







Give a memorable name to your new Visual Studio Online account 
and confirm [your account's location](set-up-vs.md#AccountLocation). For a better experience, 
select the location closest to most users in your account.

5. If you're a new Visual Studio user, you can change your settings here, 
or change them later in Visual Studio options. Otherwise, your personalized settings will be applied.

Your changes are saved with your profile, and your settings roam with you wherever you sign in.
